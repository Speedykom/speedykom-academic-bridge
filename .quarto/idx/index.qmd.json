AI is replacing the drivers themselves.\n:::\n\n## The Final Transition: Autonomous Everything {background-color=\"#1a1a2e\"}\n\n::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**Where We Are Now:**\n\n- **Tesla Autopilot** — 500,000+ cars with self-driving capability\n- **Waymo** — Robotaxis operating in San Francisco, Phoenix\n- **Self-driving trucks** — Testing on highways globally\n- **Drones** — Autonomous delivery, surveillance, agriculture\n\n**Timeline:**\n- 2015: First autopilot features\n- 2020: Full self-driving beta\n- 2024: Robotaxis commercially operating\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**What This Means:**\n\n- The \"driver\" — human decision-making behind the wheel — is being eliminated\n- Same pattern as horses → cars, but faster\n- 100 years for horse-to-car transition\n- **Maybe 15-20 years for driver-to-AI transition**\n\n**The Pattern Completes:**\n- Horse (biological amplifier) → \n- Car (mechanical amplifier) →\n- AI Car (cognitive replacement)\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n**Human drivers are the new horses.** Necessary for now, but becoming obsolete.\n:::\n\n::: {.notes}\nThis is where we are now.

Students need to be prepared for this reality.\n:::\n\n## What AI Can Replace in Africa {background-color=\"#1a1a2e\"}\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\nIf a job involves pattern recognition, rule-based decisions, or information processing, AI can likely replace it.\n:::\n\n**Examples across sectors:**\n\n::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**Transportation:**\n- Boda-boda route optimization\n- Truck drivers\n- Traffic management\n\n**Agriculture:**\n- Crop disease diagnosis\n- Irrigation decisions\n- Market price prediction\n\n**Healthcare:**\n- Initial patient triage\n- Lab test analysis\n- Disease outbreak detection\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**Finance:**\n- Credit scoring\n- Fraud detection\n- Claims processing\n\n**Education:**\n- Automated grading\n- Personalized learning\n- Career matching\n\n**Government:**\n- Document verification\n- Tax auditing\n- Benefit eligibility\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## What AI CANNOT Replace (Yet) {background-color=\"#1a1a2e\"}\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nThe human elements that remain essential:\n:::\n\n::: {.incremental}\n- **Complex ethical judgments** — What *should* we do?\n- **True creativity** — Novel solutions to new problems\n- **Human empathy** — Understanding context and emotion\n- **Cross-domain strategy** — Connecting dots across silos\n- **Accountability** — Someone must be responsible\n:::\n\n::: {.notes}\nThis is where humans remain essential.
