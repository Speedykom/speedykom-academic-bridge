### Turning Academic Assignments into Real Solutions

**Saturday, February 21, 2026**  
**9:00 AM — 11:00 AM CET**

## The Reality Check {background-color="#1e3a5f"}

![Students presenting their solar car project](images/school_projects.jpg)

---

## The Reality Check {background-color="#1e3a5f"}

::: {.incremental}
Universities produce thousands of projects every year:

- Mobile apps
- AI diagnostic tools
- E-learning platforms
- Smart agriculture systems
- Fintech solutions
:::

. . .

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**...but only a small fraction ever see real-world use.**

## Why Do Projects Fail? {background-color="#1e3a5f"}

![Students in engineering lab](images/school_projects2.jpg)

---

## Why Do Projects Fail? {background-color="#1e3a5f"}

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Academic Mindset:**

- Built for grades, not users
- Ignore existing infrastructure
- Assume perfect conditions
- One-time build, no maintenance
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Reality:**

- Users have real needs
- Systems already exist
- Connectivity is limited
- Sustainability matters
:::

:::

---

## Common Projects That Fail {background-color="#1e3a5f"}

::: {.incremental}
1. **"Uber for X" Apps** — Ignore low smartphone penetration
2. **Standalone E-Learning** — Universities already use Moodle
3. **AI Diagnostic Tools** — No validation with real medical data
4. **IoT Agriculture Sensors** — Farmers can't afford hardware
5. **Blockchain Voting** — Trust issues are social, not technical
6. **"Better than M-Pesa" Apps** — Ignore regulatory requirements
:::

---

## What Students Need {background-color="#1e3a5f"}

**Technical Skills:**

---

## Critical Questions {background-color="#1e3a5f"}

::: {.callout-important}
Before you write a single line of code:
:::

::: {.incremental}
- Who will maintain this in 5 years?
- How does it connect to existing systems?
- What happens when the internet is down?
- Why would someone pay for this?

## 5,500 Years of Partnership {background-color="#1e3a5f"}

![Mongolian pastoralist with horse](images/origin_horses.webp)

---

## 5,500 Years of Partnership {background-color="#1e3a5f"}

**The Beginning (~3500 BCE):**

- **Where:** Kazakhstan (Botai culture)
- **What:** First domestication of horses

**The Partnership:**
- Humans bred horses for strength and speed
- A symbiotic relationship developed

---

## Horses Enabled Civilization {background-color="#1e3a5f"}

**For Millennia:**

- **Agriculture** — plowing fields, transporting harvests
- **Commerce** — trade routes, carrying goods
- **Warfare** — cavalry charges, logistics
- **Communication** — messengers, postal systems

---

## The Horse-Drawn Era {background-color="#1e3a5f"}

![Horse and buggy carriage](images/Horse-and-buggy-Shutterstock.webp)

---

## The Horse-Drawn Era {background-color="#1e3a5f"}

**Peak of Horse Power:**

- Every city had thousands of horses
- Stables on every corner
- Horse-drawn trams and buses
- Individual horse ownership common

**Even in WWII:** Horses moved supplies and artillery when trucks failed.

---

## The Machine Age Arrives {background-color="#1e3a5f"}

**The Steam Engine (1800s):**

- First machines matching horse power
- Trains moved faster than any horse
- But still needed human operators

**The Internal Combustion Engine (1885+):**

- Benz creates first practical automobile
- Ford's Model T (1908) makes cars affordable

---

## The Collapse {background-color="#1e3a5f"}

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Timeline:**

- **1900:** 21 million horses in the US
- **1920:** Cars outnumber horses in cities
- **1940:** Horses rare in developed world
- **1960:** Horses mainly for recreation
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**The Math:**

- 5,500 years of partnership
- Gone in 50 years

**Horses didn't become extinct.**

**They became obsolete for work.**
:::

:::

## From Work to Recreation {background-color="#1e3a5f"}

![Electric horseless carriage for events](images/Absolute-Perfect-Electric-Horseless-Carriage-for-Special-Events-Landau-6-Passenger-Vis-a-Vis-Carriage.avif)

---

## The Pattern Emerges {background-color="#1e3a5f"}

::: {.incremental}
1. **Tool as Amplifier** — Horse extends muscle power
2. **Tool as Partner** — Human + animal capability
3. **Machine as Amplifier** — Car extends reach faster
4. **Machine as Replacement** — No feeding, rest, training needed
:::

---

## From Mechanical to Cognitive {background-color="#1e3a5f"}

**Industrial Revolution:**

- Replaced physical labor
- Machines stronger than muscles
- But still needed human operators

**AI Revolution:**

- Replacing cognitive labor
- AI faster at pattern recognition
- **Can make decisions autonomously**

---

## The Final Transition {background-color="#1e3a5f"}

![Waymo autonomous taxi](images/waymo_taxi.avif)

---

## The Final Transition {background-color="#1e3a5f"}

**Where We Are Now:**

- **Tesla Autopilot** — 500,000+ cars with self-driving
- **Waymo** — Robotaxis in San Francisco, Phoenix
- **Self-driving trucks** — Testing on highways globally

**Timeline:**

- 2015: First autopilot features
- 2020: Full self-driving beta
- 2024: Robotaxis commercially operating

---

## Human Drivers: The New Horses {background-color="#1e3a5f"}

::: {.callout-warning}
**The "driver" — human decision-making behind the wheel — is being eliminated.**
:::

**The Pattern Completes:**

- Horse (biological amplifier) → 
- Car (mechanical amplifier) →
- AI Car (cognitive replacement)

---

## Beyond Driving {background-color="#1e3a5f"}

![Dubai self-flying drone taxi](images/dubai_self_flying_drone.webp)

---

## The Robot Revolution {background-color="#1e3a5f"}

**Physical Robots:**

- Boston Dynamics Atlas — Humanoid robots
- Tesla Optimus — Factory work
- Warehouse robots — Amazon fulfillment
- Surgical robots — Da Vinci operations

---

## The Robot Revolution {background-color="#1e3a5f"}

**Cognitive AI:**

- ChatGPT/Claude — Writing, coding, analysis
- Computer vision — Disease diagnosis
- Trading algorithms — Financial decisions
- Content generation — Art, music, video

---

## The New Reality {background-color="#1e3a5f"}

::: {.callout-important}
**Anything that requires a brain to make decisions can be replaced by AI.**
:::

**Each transition accelerates:**

- Horses: 5,500 years
- Cars: 50 years  
- AI: **Maybe 15-20 years**
